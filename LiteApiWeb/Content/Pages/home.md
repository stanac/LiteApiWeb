        <h1>LiteApi</h1>
        <p>
            LiteApi is ASP.NET Core middleware for implementing RESTful APIs.
            <br />
            Without server side rendering engine LiteApi is made for developers who are writing SPA applications.
        </p>

<div class='col-md-4'>
<span class='sub'>Lightweight</span>
<br/>
No rendering engine, only WebApi with JSON support and planned extensibility points for other formats.
</div>

<div class='col-md-4'>
<span class='sub'>Easy to use</span>
<br/>
Controllers with conventions you likely already know how to use. Check getting started, if you already used MVC WebAPI you will find
using LiteApi to be like a walk in the park.
</div>

<div class='col-md-4'>
<span class='sub'>Cross platform</span>
<br/>
Compiled to .NET Standard 1.6 means LiteApi works on Linux, macOS, and Windows.

<div class='row'>

<div class='col-md-4'>
<span class='sub'>Feature rich</span>
<br/>
Get parameters from query, header, body or route segment. Pass array, dictionary or create your own parameter type handler.
</div>

<div class='col-md-4'>
<span class='sub'>Authorization done right</span>
<br/>
Authentication is left for other middlewares, configurable authorization with predefined filters and ability to create your own.
</div>

<div class='col-md-4'>
<span class='sub'>Extensible</span>
<br/>
Extensibility points are already here for some parts of the middleware, more will be available soon.
</div>

<h3>Why?</h3>
Why would someone write a middleware which features are already handled by ASP.NET Core MVC? <br/>
- A large chunk of today's web apps are written as SPAs. From that perspective, server side rendering is not needed.
That's where LiteApi steps in.
