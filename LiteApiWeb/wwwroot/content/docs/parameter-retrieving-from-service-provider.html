<p id="pragma-line-3">Sometimes there is just one action in controller that depends on a service.
In order to avoid injecting the service for all action calls in that
controller we can inject the service only when appropriate action
method is called. This can be done using <code>FromServicesAttribute</code>
(located in <code>LiteApi.Attributes</code> namespace) which should be set on
parameter level. Here is an example:</p>
<pre><code id="pragma-line-10" class="language-csharp">public int Add(int a, int b, [FromServices]IMathOps theService)  
{
    return theService.Add(a, b);
}
</code></pre>
<p id="pragma-line-17">It should be noted that you can have regular parameters from body/query/route/header
next to your dependency-injected parameter, order of parameters is not important.
Dependency-injected parameter is resolved from IServiceProvider, so any service
that is registered on app level can be retrieved this way. It is possible to
injected more than one parameter this way.</p>
